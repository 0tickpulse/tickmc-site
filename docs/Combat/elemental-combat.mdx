# Elemental Combat

In TickMC, combat is based around an elemental damage system. There are two types of damage in this server:

- Normal damage - This is vanilla Minecraft damage. We aim to remove all sources of this damage, but it is still present in some cases.
- Elemental damage - This is the main type of damage in TickMC.

## Damage events

Individual damage events can have multiple elements. The damage for each element is [individually calculated](/Combat/damage-formula), and then added together to get the final damage.
Elemental damage events cause **damage indicators** to be displayed on the screen. These indicators are different for each element, and are displayed in the color of the element.

In the above damage, 8 <CombatElement element="earth" /> damage and 2 <CombatElement element="ice" /> damage was dealt.

Critical hits result in a larger damage indicator ([Note that crit calculation occurs after adding all elemental damage together](/Combat/damage-formula)).
