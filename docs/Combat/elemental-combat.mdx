# Elemental Combat

In TickMC, combat is based around an elemental damage system. There are two types of damage in this server:

- Normal damage - This is vanilla Minecraft damage. We aim to remove all sources of this damage, but it is still present in some cases.
- Elemental damage - This is the main type of damage in TickMC.

## Damage events

Individual damage events can have multiple elements. The damage for each element is [individually calculated](/docs/Combat/damage-formula), and then added together to get the final damage.
Elemental damage events cause **damage indicators** to be displayed on the screen. These indicators are different for each element, and are displayed in the color of the element.

In the above damage, 8 <CombatElement element="earth" /> damage and 2 <CombatElement element="ice" /> damage was dealt.

Critical hits result in a larger damage indicator ([Note that crit calculation occurs after adding all elemental damage together](/docs/Combat/damage-formula)).

## Elements

Each of the elements have their own focus and playstyle. However, take note that these are just guidelines, and items can technically have any element regardless of their playstyle.
Elements are unrestricted, meaning that you can use any element you want - there is no class system.

### Earth

<CombatElement element="earth" /> focuses on defense and tanking. It has the highest health and defense of all elements, but has low damage and speed.

### Ender

<CombatElement element="ender" /> focuses on mobility, providing high amounts of speed, but low amounts of other stats.

### Fire

<CombatElement element="fire" /> focuses on damage over time.

### Ice

<CombatElement element="ice" /> focuses on debuffing enemies, such as decreasing their damage.

### Light

<CombatElement element="light" /> is an all-rounder, with no specific strengths or weaknesses.

### Physical

<CombatElement element="physical" /> focuses on dealing high amounts of damage to singular targets.

### Shadow

<CombatElement element="shadow" /> focuses on dealing high amounts of damage to multiple targets.

### Thunder

<CombatElement element="thunder" /> focuses on buffing allies, such as increasing their damage.

### Water

<CombatElement element="water" /> focuses on healing and support, similar to <CombatElement element="earth" />.

### Wind

<CombatElement element="wind" /> focuses on decreasing enemy mobility, such as by knocking them back.
